## About
pySpeech is a text-to-speech program developed with Python. The program converts given text inserted by the user to audio outputted through 
the user's device. The user may choose to enter their own personalized message through the keyboard, or import pre-existing .txt files.

## Resources
To obtain the phoneme pronunciations for various words, we used a pre-existing dictionary provided by the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) found here http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict. This file has been imported into the project as a simple readable file labelled 'Words.txt', and contains the phoneme pronunciations for over 300,000 words.
